Hello everyone! I will be participating in the Google Summer of Code 2021. I will be working on adding podcast support to [Kasts](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6682134443458560).  
Originally I was supposed to add podcast support to a different KDE app, [Alligator](https://apps.kde.org/alligator/). We had several discussions on the Plasma Mobile matrix room and the sole merge request with a basic podcast support which had huge improvements added by Bart De Vries was ultimately split into another app, [Kasts](https://apps.kde.org/kasts/).  
This project will be mentored by <strong>Tobias Fella</strong> and <strong>Devin Lin</strong>, two of the core developers at KDE Community. It was really nice of Bart De Vries, who so graciously decided to help me with my project.
Now, a little overview of the project and the app in general.  
The goal of this GSoC project is to work on the application Kasts which is a convergent podcast player, it works both on desktop and mobile devices thanks to the QtQuick and the Kirigami library. The major part of the project is to work on the UI and to provide a seamless experience to Kasts so it could work on all sorts of devices.  
One of the more important features is to add support for discovering podcasts over the internet, currently we have decided to use the [GPodder Search API](https://gpodder.net/search/). Addition of this would mean Kasts could work as a full blown podcatcher.  
Later I will work on adding Platform Integration for Kasts and providing android notifications as well.  
I am really excited to spend this summer working with my mentors on this awesome project.  
Thanks.
